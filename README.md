HDDM -- Detailed Posterior Predictive Checks
Note that this script was initially created to perform posterior predictive checks (PPCs) for regression models that have been fitted within HDDM and that utilized the LAN extension. However, the script can be adjusted to be applicable to models without regression equations and/or that have been fitted using the "classical HDDM" without the LAN extension
